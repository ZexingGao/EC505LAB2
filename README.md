HW2, SplayTree implementation in C
According to the second client email we received, we made some high level analysis and estimation on this case study extension. There are five issues, and we consider them as five different extractors as we did for our case study. The deadline for those five issues is proposed at the end of Q1 next year, and our estimate would be at the end of February, so we can have extra time if anything goes wrong. 


First issue is the Merger with Corpex Bank. We think the biggest problem would be the data structure from Corpex would be different from our current data structure. It would be very hard to merge data with different structures. But still it is possible, and we think we can do it within two months. 

Second issue is the intraday statistics. As our trader think the current data transfer frequent is too low, we decided to develop an automatic data transferring program in order to increase the transferring frequency from once per day to once per hour. This will take us 1 month. 

Third issue is the strike rate metadata.
